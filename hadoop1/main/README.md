## Hadoop1 image

Installed using the walkthrough we received at the start of the MSE BDA course.

The hadoop local install is located under $HOME/hadoop.
The hadoop pseudo-distributed install is located under $HOME/hadoop-dist.

*Note*: if you can't use `ssh localhost` at the start of the container, restart the service: `sudo service ssh restart`
